- [ ] The client must create a local file with the same name as the socket
- [x] A server must be running that is listening for socket connections
- [ ] The server must allocate sufficient memory to handle any needed retransmissions
- [ ] The client must be in the same folder as the server
- [ ] The client must be on the same system as the server

- [ ] 119
- [ ] 80
- [ ] 142
- [ ] 420

### 11. What port is used by default for Secure HTTP (https)?

- [ ] 80
- [ ] 142
- [ ] 25
- [x] 443
- [ ] 119

- [ ] RFC5325
- [ ] RFC815
- [x] RFC792

### 15. What is the purpose of `encode()` in the `socketl.py` code:

- [ ] To make sure that the web server properly recognizes the GET command
- [ ] To break the data into packets for network transmission
- [x] To convert the data to UTF-8 before sending
- [ ] To check if there is any data ready to send

### 16. What can't you see in the Browser Developer Mode for most browsers?
